# <Timed-Trivia-Quiz>
## Description
My motivation for this project was to create a timed trivia quiz in order to gain a better understanding of traversing the DOM and manipulating it using Javascript. I beleive I accomplished that goal, and have learned a lot though trial and error. I will on revisit this project later to style the page when I have more time. My primary goal was to get the application functioning properly which it does.
